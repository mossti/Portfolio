## Overview
This project involved the design of a hexapod, involving 3D printing and design of mechanical and electrical components, research into gait analysis, and the use of ROS to tie everything together. The result is a hexapod which can move in the four cardinal directions as well as having the ability to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise.

You can see the demo video below:

The gait utilizes bio-inspired elliptical motion to reduce required torque on the actuators. In fact, compliance is a large theme in this hexapod, with the joints 'floating' and able to bend depending on external forces.
