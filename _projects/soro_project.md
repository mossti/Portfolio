## Overview
This was an extracurricular project between myself and a few other students in Dr. Mitra Hartmann's 2019 Soft Robotics course. The motivation for designing and building this manifold was to get a better sense of the current state of DIY fluid actuation. We worked without any pre-existing kits, and instead relied on our summed knowledge of circuitry and fluid mechanics. We tested the resultant manifold on a number of fabricated McKibben muscles along with a few novel soft actuators that were designed by students in the aforementioned class.
