The goal with this project was to design a cable-driven series elastic actuator (SEA) for use in a rehabilitative exoskeleton. Key features are back-driveability (following angular deflection), generation of impedance (resisting angular deflection), and actuation via the cable drive.

You can see the demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_MqyhAG-6s)!
