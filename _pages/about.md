<!-- Andrew was first introduced to robotics in his youth, participating in and eventually becoming an officer of his high schoolâ€™s robotics & design team. He would go on to participate in a wide range of research interests while attending Indiana University, including questions in endocrinology, digital humanities, and (most centrally) the biophysics of vision. Throughout all lines of research, the primary drive was to better understand the differences and similarities between biological and mechanical systems. He graduated from Indiana University in 2017 with a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in Folklore & Ethnomusicology. Andrew then joined on as a lab manager for the [de Ruyter Biophysics](https://www.biocomplexity.indiana.edu/research/info/deruyter.php) lab, where he spent a year working on software design for the generation of experimental stimuli as well as for neural recording. The position additionally involved analysis of experimental data as well as the maintenance and development of laboratory resources. 

In the summer of 2018, Andrew departed from Indiana to the distant land of Chicago, Illinois. There, he began as a student in Northwestern's [Masters of Science in Robotics (MSR)](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/robotics/) program (graduated from in Fall 2019). Andrew is now a rising 5th year pursuing a PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University ([argallab](https://www.argallab.northwestern.edu/)), where he hopes to further explore the interface between human and artifice. After graduation he intends to enter the field of assistive robotics, with particular interest in computational geometry and low-cost, high-access solutions. -->

Hello! I am attending graduate school as a PhD student at Northwestern University studying assistive robotics. My interests specifically lie in assistive + rehabilitative technologies, machine learning, biomechanics, and the development of machines that interface with living systems.

I attended Indiana University for my undergrad and majored in Physics (B.S.) and Folklore (B.A.). People tend to scratch their heads at that one, but I hold a deep belief in the power of interdisciplinary education, especially as it pertains to problem-solving and developing a more intuitive understanding of our world.
Following graduation, I attended Northwestern University as a member of the 2018 MSR (Master of Science in Robotics) program. Since then I have been working as a PhD student (and more recently candidate) studying assistive robotics (with a focus in the design of control interfaces and safety algorithms) in Dr. Brenna Argall's lab ([argallab](https://www.argallab.northwestern.edu/)), housed at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.

I love to learn and I love to build! Feel free to contact me if you know of opportunities for curious creators.
